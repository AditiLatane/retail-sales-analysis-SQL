# Retail Sales Analysis (SQL Project)

##  Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing retail sales data to uncover insights related to sales performance, customer behavior, revenue trends, and profitability. The analysis includes data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), profitability analysis, and answering real-world business questions using SQL.

##  (1) Data Cleaning

Since the dataset is imported from a CSV file, data types of all columns are finalized to avoid further complications during analysis.

### 1. Column Renaming

* Renamed 2 columns for better clarity and consistency

### 2. Data Type Standardization

* IDs & Numbers
* Dates & Time
* Text Columns
* Monetary Columns

## (2) Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

### 1. Overview of Data

* Understanding data structure and basic information

### 2. Data Quality Checks

* Checking uniqueness
* Checking null values
* Checking duplicate records

### 3. Descriptive Statistics

* Minimum values
* Maximum values
* Average values

### 4. Categorical Distribution

* Sales by category
* Gender distribution

### 5. Revenue Analysis

* Total revenue
* Revenue by category
* Revenue by gender

### 6. Time-Based EDA

* Daily sales
* Monthly sales
* Peak sales hours

### 7. Customer-Level EDA

* Top customers
* Average sales per customer

## 8. Profitability Analysis

* Profit per transaction
* Profit by category
* Profit by gender

## 9. Outlier Detection

* Identification of very high sales values
